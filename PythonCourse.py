Automorphic number using Python
Check Whether or Not the Number is an Automorphic Number in Python
Given an integer input for a number, the objective is to check whether or not the number is Automorphic or not. Therefore we’ll write a program to Check Whether or Not the Number is an Automorphic Number in Python Language.

Example
Input : 5
Output : It's an Automorphic Number.
automorphic number or not in python
Check Whether or Not the Number is an Automorphic Number in Python Language
Given an integer input as the number the objective is to check whether or not the number is an Automorphic number. To do we’ll first square the number and check if the number has been repeated in the same order of digits at the end of it’s square. For a Number to be Automorphic, it must pass the below mentioned condition

Automorphic Number
A number whose square ends with the same number is known as an Automorphic number.
Let's try and understand it even better using an example ,

Example
Input : number = 5
Output : It's an Automorphic number.
Explanation : Number = 5
Square of number = 25
as the square of the number ends with the number itself, It's an Automorphic number.
Therefore, for a number to be Automorphic it number have a square that ends with the number itself.
